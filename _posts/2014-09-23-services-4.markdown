---
- These tours are based on career options where all learners which are part of the Career guidance program from different schools
will be grouped and visit an organization offering those career options.

- This is where learners will be taken for a tour in that specific organization, attend presentations given by key senior Managers in the organization, and be assigned a mentor for the day to get practical answers to their questions.
After this tour, a learner will have a clear understanding of what his/ her career choice entails practically and be able to
make informed decisions.

- Post the tour â€“ Learners will have brief group sessions with career PR actioners and this is where learners will short list at least top two career options of their choices.
